Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure. It has the following properties âˆ’

One node is marked as Root node.

Every node other than the root is associated with one parent node.

Each node can have an arbiatry number of chid node.

We create a tree data structure in python by using the concept os node discussed earlier.
 We designate one node as root node and then add more nodes as child nodes. Below is program to create the root node.

class Node:

    #create
    def __init__(self,data) -> None:
        self.left=None
        self.right=None
        self.data=data
        pass
    
    #Insert
    def insert(self,data):
        if data < self.data:
            if self.left is None:
                self.left=Node(data)
            else:
                self.left.data=data
        elif data > self.data:
            if self.right is None:
                self.right=Node(data)
            else:
                self.right.data=data
        else:
            self.data=data
    
    #Read

   # Print the tree
    def PrintTree(self):
      if self.left:
         self.left.PrintTree()
      print( self.data),
      if self.right:
         self.right.PrintTree()

  Traversing a Tree
The tree can be traversed by deciding on a sequence to visit each node. As we can clearly see we can start at a node then visit the left sub-tree first and right sub-tree next. Or we can also visit the right sub-tree first and left sub-tree next. Accordingly there are different names for these tree traversal methods.

Tree Traversal Algorithms
Traversal is a process to visit all the nodes of a tree and may print their values too. Because, all nodes are connected via edges (links) we always start from the root (head) node. That is, we cannot randomly access a node in a tree. There are three ways which we use to traverse a tree.

In-order Traversal

Pre-order Traversal

Post-order Traversal

In-order Traversal
In this traversal method, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right sub-tree. We should always remember that every node may represent a subtree itself.

In the below python program, we use the Node class to create place holders for the root node as well as the left and right nodes. Then, we create an insert function to add data to the tree. Finally, the In-order traversal logic is implemented by creating an empty list and adding the left node first followed by the root or parent node.

At last the left node is added to complete the In-order traversal. Please note that this process is repeated for each sub-tree until all the nodes are traversed.
'''
# Inorder traversal
# Left -> Root -> Right
def inorderTraversal(self, root):
    res = []
    if root:
        res = self.inorderTraversal(root.left)
        res.append(root.data)
        res = res + self.inorderTraversal(root.right)
    return res

'''
Pre-order Traversal
In this traversal method, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree.

In the below python program, we use the Node class to create place holders for the root node as well as the left and right nodes. Then, we create an insert function to add data to the tree. Finally, the Pre-order traversal logic is implemented by creating an empty list and adding the root node first followed by the left node.

At last, the right node is added to complete the Pre-order traversal. Please note that, this process is repeated for each sub-tree until all the nodes are traversed.
'''
# Preorder traversal
# Root -> Left ->Right
def PreorderTraversal(self, root):
    res = []
    if root:
        res.append(root.data)
        res = res + self.PreorderTraversal(root.left)
        res = res + self.PreorderTraversal(root.right)
    return res

'''
Post-order Traversal
In this traversal method, the root node is visited last, hence the name. First, we traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node.

In the below python program, we use the Node class to create place holders for the root node as well as the left and right nodes. Then, we create an insert function to add data to the tree. Finally, the Post-order traversal logic is implemented by creating an empty list and adding the left node first followed by the right node.

At last the root or parent node is added to complete the Post-order traversal. Please note that, this process is repeated for each sub-tree until all the nodes are traversed.

'''
# Postorder traversal
# Left ->Right -> Root
def PostorderTraversal(self, root):
    res = []
    if root:
        res = self.PostorderTraversal(root.left)
        res = res + self.PostorderTraversal(root.right)
        res.append(root.data)
    return res
